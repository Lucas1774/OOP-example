THIS WAS A COLLEGE PROJECT.

## Program

It represents the app that runs a COVID clinic during the pandemic. The interface can be used by every type of agent, and recognizes such type from his credentials.  
The logic behind assigning a nurse to a test appointment is complex, and it might not be properly implemented.

It was super fun to just type Java for three days straight. It has some mildly interesting functions and I got to learn some methods from some of the standard Java libraries.  
I really liked working in BlueJ, it really fulfills its purpose, but it lacks some commodities.

## Usage

Since it doesn't have persistent memory, you have to first log in as "admin, admin". Once you have registered some users you can explore the program, always from the same terminal and keeping it open.
